All roles are randomized. This has a few material changes:

    * Seer looks in middle 50% of the time
    * Witch takes suspicious roles for herself 50% of the time
    * PI and medium always look at first role, look at second role 50% of the time
    * Village idiot doesn't rotate 20% of the time
    * Troublemaker, robber, and witch always act
    * No one can plan around village idiot affecting nearby locations
    * Village idiot can't choose direction based on shield
    * Curator marks a revealed player with the same probability rate as other players
    * Doppelganger troublemaker switches troublemaker at same probability
    * Doppelganger revealer reveals the revealer at same probability
    * Doppelganger curator marks the curator at same probability
    * Doppelganger witch never switches the witch
    * Doppelganger robber never robs the robber
    * Doppelganger PI never looks at the PI
